Hi there!

This little piece of software lets you control your SJ4000 Wifi Action Camera with an ESP8266.

Just turn on your Cam an let the ESP do the rest for you!

The sketch WIFI-Cam.ino starts a recording for approximately 5s and stops it later on.

In future I will build a software which acts like a remote which you can wear on your wrist, like the remmote for GoPro Cammeras!.

Questions: Feel free to ask!

Big Thanks to charly_01 from :

who had the original idea, which included an Arduino and an ESP8266.
I've just ported the idea to the ESP as a standalone piece of hardware.


Have fun and a good Day!
